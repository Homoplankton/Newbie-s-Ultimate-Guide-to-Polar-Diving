# Introduction

Hello everyone, I'm **Jialing Cai**, a blackwater photographer from **Chongqing, China**. 

Last November, I was selected as the **2026 Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) NextGen Scholar**. GUE is a diving organization built on rigorous, high-standard training and deeply engaged in scientific exploration and marine conservation. I am honored to be the only scholarship recipient worldwide and the first from China. I'm currently receiving a full year of extremely generous support from GUE—including diving courses, equipment, and community resources that allow me to refine my techniques, venture to places I once wouldn’t have dared to go, and document even more planktonic life.

**Through GUE, I was also given a fully funded, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to dive in Antarctica** this January, joining a two-week-long expedition with **BlueGreen Expeditions**, alongside renowned underwater photographers and polar biologists.

Surprisingly, besides tremendous amount of excitement that an Antarctic trip deserves, I was also overwhelmed by tension and anxiety.

At the time, there was just two months left before departure, and I was nothing more than a tropical diver spoiled by days in 27°C Southeast Asian waters. **I didn’t know how to use a drysuit, couldn’t lift tanks, and didn’t even know how to independently assemble my own gear** (because in Southeast Asia, someone always does it for you!). If I couldn’t meet the technical demands of Antarctic diving and safely, calmly enjoy everything underwater, then traveling to the end of the world would be nothing but an unnecessary odyssey.

I could have easily quit, because no one was forcing me to go. I could also have chosen to visit Antarctica simply as a carefree tourist and skip diving altogether. **But carrying the halo of GUE and being an underwater photographer, not diving ?! Would that make any sense**?!

>In the end, I couldn’t resist the temptation of saving a fortune on a free Antarctic trip, nor could I let go of my stubborn pride as an underwater photographer.
>
**So I decided to grit my teeth and crash-course my way into becoming a polar diver within a single month.**

The fact that I can sit here now and write this article means I made it back alive. Not only that, both I and all my camera and diving gear returned completely unscathed. I completed 7 dives in Antarctica, encountering penguins, leopard seals, and my favorites—sea angels and sea butterflies. But the most important thing wasn’t the magical creatures themselves. **It was that, even in the icy water, I still had the capacity to pause, and truly absorb the beauty from them.** 

So I can now say with confidence that, although my preparation in such a short time wasn’t ideal, it was sufficient. If you also dream of polar diving, this article can offer you some practical guidance.

# Standard Procedures for Antarctic Diving

For those like me, pampered and babysit by the diving industry in Southeast Asia, you must first accept these rules:

- **Antarctica does not offer discovery dives.** 
You must be a certified diver with cold-water experience.

- **There is no equipment rental in Antarctica.** 
You must bring all of the your own gear. 

- **You must be a self-reliant diver.** 
No one will help carry, assemble and check your equipment.

- **There are no dive guides underwater.** 
You are responsible for yourself and must look out for your buddy.

- **There are no decompression chambers in Antarctica**
All dives must be extremely conservative.

One way to dive in Antarctica is by joining a cruise that offers diving options. In my case, **GUE** sent me to join **BlueGreen Expeditions** for a two-week long trip in early January.

January is summer in Antarctica, and the waters we visited ranged from **–1°C to 4°C**, staying mostly around **1–2°C**.

Each day was split roughly in half between diving and either landing on islands or taking zodiac cruises. The diving schedule was very conservative: only **one dive** per day, with a maximum duration of **40 minutes** and a maximum depth of **18 meters**. No matter how slowly you consumed air, every dive had to end **within 40** minutes. This was a strict rule.

Our cruise had 50 divers and was split into two rounds. We took turns joining either Round 1 or Round 2. For each dive, we boarded zodiacs from the mother ship, with 5–6 people per boat, and formed 2–3 person buddy teams on our own.

The expedition guides would take all the zodiacs to the same dive area, but each boat entered the water at a slightly different spot. This meant that even though more than 20 people were underwater at the same time, sometimes you only saw the people on your own boat or just your buddy. The other divers were spread out around you, but often out of sight.

It’s worth emphasizing again: ==there are no dive guides underwater.==

The expedition guides’ job is only to take the zodiacs to the dive site, and keep an eye on the bubbles you create underwater to roughly monitor your locations and pick you up afterward. **During those 30–40 minutes underwater, how long to stay, where to swim, and how deep to go is entirely up to you and your buddy** (within the designated depths and area, of course). If you get separated from your buddy, you have one minute to search. If you can’t find them, you must ascend and end the dive.

# Risks of Iceberg Diving

When diving in Antarctica, you get to see how icebergs extend beneath the water’s surface. Each iceberg has a unique texture and structure at its base, and sunlight filtering through the ice scatters into different shades of blue.

**We don’t dive directly under floating ice** cuz that requires specialized ice-diving certification. Instead, we dive in open water around the iceberg. The guides select an iceberg with their expert knowledge that appears stable and unlikely to collapse or flip, and designate our diving area accordingly.

But even with the utmost caution, there’s no way to guarantee that all nearby icebergs are completely stable. Sometimes, a neighboring iceberg can suddenly collapse or flip, sending a strong current through the water and stirring up sediment and ice fragments. Visibility drops instantly, and in moments like that, getting separated from your buddy can happen very quickly.

Even trickier are the strange buoyancy changes around icebergs. The water there is a mix of freshwater and seawater. Meltwater from the icebergs stays near the surface, while denser seawater sinks below, forming a **halocline**. But this isn’t a straight, stable boundary. Currents and water movement can cause it to ripple and twist. In practice, I could be hovering at a certain depth, fully focused on taking photos, when suddenly, without warning, I’d start sinking. I’d quickly inflate my BCD to stabilize, only to shoot upward like a balloon moments later.

At first, I almost despaired, thinking that a month of hard training in buoyancy control had been wiped out, and I was back to being a flailing, clumsy mess. Then, in frustration, I looked around and realized that several other divers were bouncing up and down too. One would sink, another would shoot upward. Suddenly, the usually solemn surroundings of the iceberg were filled with a comical scene of everyone out of control.

So, only an extremely solid foundation of diving skills can prepare you to handle this kind of unpredictable environment.

# Skills You Need

## My Diving Background 

Before preparing for Antarctic diving, here was my diving background:

- **Certification:** PADI Rescue Diver
- **Drysuit experience:** almost none
	- PADI Drysuit Course in Australia (zip wasn't fully closed, drysuit fully flooded)
    - GUE Fundamentals at Fuxian Lake (Provisional Pass, but basically did not pass)
    - Aside from these two courses, I've no drysuit experience on my own
- **Number of dives:** 500+
    - All in tropical waters, within 30 meters
    - About 400 of these dives were blackwater photography

In reality, there are only two core skills required for diving in extreme cold conditions:

>**1. Proficient use of a drysuit, including thick undergarments and dry gloves**
>**2. Regulator failure management**

But anyone who has tried drysuits knows how deep the rabbit hole goes! Mastering this skill in a short time, especially under the shadow of a previous drysuit flooding accident and almost failing GUE Fundamentals, was truly intimidating.

So I turned to my GUE mentor Mr. Yanbin Wu, for help —

>“GUE is sending me to Antarctica. I’m sure you want me to be able to come back, right?”

## Training to Prepare for Antarctic Diving

About a month before departure, I went all in, starting almost from scratch to get familiar with cold-water diving.

**Late November – Qiandao Lake, Zhejiang, China (18°C) – 7 days**

<u>GUE Doubles Primer</u> + <u>Performance Diver courses</u>

Drysuit with double tanks + thick undergarment

Instructor: Wu Yanbin

**Early December – Fuxian Lake, Yunnan, China (16°C) – 7 days**

Fun Dives + Workshops with three GUE instructors (Wu Yanbin, Weiky, Dongdong)

Drysuit with double tanks + thick undergarment

**Late December – Anilao, Philippines (27°C) – 10 days**

Blackwater Divings

Drysuit with double tanks

**Early January – Departure for Antarctica!**

I’ll share detailed insights on the GUE courses in separate posts, but for now, here’s a brief summary of what I achieved. Over the course of a month, I completed about **50 dives in a drysuit with double tanks**, including 30 dives in **16–18°C** cold water wearing a thick undergarment. 

This training focused on addressing the three most urgent challenges I faced at the time:

>[!Challenges]
>
>**First**, **independently assembling and donning my gear.** Unexpected right? Before this, even as a professional underwater photographer, I hadn’t developed this basic diver skill. Honestly, I’ve made it this far alive only thanks to the help of kind human beings and sheer luck.
>
>**Second**, **inflating and deflating the drysuit**, and maintaining stable ascents and descents. This completely eliminated my fear of drysuit. I used to be terrified that any inflation would send me shooting to the surface.
>
>**Third**, **performing fine tasks while wearing thick dry gloves**, such as handling my camera.

But in reality, all this preparation was still far from enough. Diving in **16–18°C** water as a practice ground for extreme Antarctic conditions is simply on a completely different level. It can’t simulate the hypothermia risk or potential equipment failures you might face in true polar waters.

The cruise operators officially recommend at least **20** practice dives in water **below 4°C**. Limited by time and location, I wasn’t able to meet this requirement. So I left a week early and went to Ushuaia, Argentina, the port city for boarding the Antarctic cruise, and went to a local dive shop for three check dives in **7°C** water. While still not as cold as 4°C, it gave me a lot more confidence. By the time I did the official Antarctic check dive, I was feeling reasonably prepared.

Although I jumped from 27°C to near 0°C in a very short time, had very little cold-water experience, and often joked about it half-heartedly, **I had never truly forced myself into the water while flailing, uncomfortable, and full of doubt**. I also hope that if you’re reading this, you won’t do that either.

## Highly Recommended Skill – Twin Tanks

Although the **GUE Doubles Primer** isn’t directly related to polar diving, it unexpectedly became one of the most practical parts of my preparation.

Polar diving uses a single tank, but with a special **H-valve** setup—one tank topped with two independent outlets, allowing two separate regulators to be connected at the same time. 

**Why two sets of regulators?** 

Because in Antarctic waters, the first stage can freeze, leak, or trigger a freeflow due to the extreme cold. Having two regulators means you have a backup: if one first stage fails, you can shut it off, switch to the other system, and safely end the dive.

The behind rationale is almost identical to double tanking: the two independent tank valves are connected by a horizontal bar with an isolation valve in the middle, but the core principle is still managing two valves and two sets of regulators. **This mindset of redundant system management transfers seamlessly to using an H-valve.**

Moreover, after practicing doubles extensively, **I was no longer afraid of fiddling with regulators.** Before, I was completely lost when it came to assembling them. A few years ago, I’d just hand the regulators to the seller to assemble and never touch them again. Which hose is high pressure or low pressure, which port each hose goes into, whether the second stage hose should loop over the left or right shoulder—all questions I’d never thought about. But with repetitive dives in doubles, I took regulators apart and put them back together, learning the underlying principles behind every hose and adjusting everything to the most comfortable configuration for myself.

On the Antarctic single-tank H-valve, the two outlets are very close together. To avoid hose entanglement, the hose routing has to be slightly different from how I normally set up my doubles, which meant I had to take a wrench and reassemble everything myself. I used to think disassembling the hoses was an incredibly daunting task, like one wrong move would break all, but after doing it repeatedly, this small task became easy and second nature.

In short, my experience with doubles diving allowed me to adapt seamlessly to the H-valve in Antarctica and gave me great confidence in my regulators.

**In my opinion, if you can handle doubles with ease, you’re already halfway to being a polar diver!**

## My Biggest Regret - Navigation

>In Southeast Asia, you follow your dive guide's fins like a living compass. 
>In Antarctica, you gotta find your own ways.

Before entering the water, the guide might outline a general area, say, circling a specific iceberg—and emphasize staying close to the ice face during descent, as it could be your sole landmark below. If you fail to fix its position firmly in your eyes, the instant it vanishes from sight, your world collapses into an endless, undifferentiated wash of gray-blue.

Once we arrived at a wreck dive site, a ship half submerged, half exposed, grounded in place. Before entering the water, we could clearly see its position and orientation. It was right there, less than 20 meters away. My buddy and I even double-checked on the surface:“See it? When we go down, we’ll just head straight for it.”

Once we were in the water, visibility dropped to just two or three meters. 

We swam toward the wreck by instinct. The distance was short, but we kept swimming for what felt like ages, and still couldn’t make out the outline of the ship. When we surfaced, **we realized we’d completely gone in the wrong direction!** Luckily, we hadn’t strayed far and were still within the same general area as the main group, so safety wasn’t an issue. But we’d just been floundering around underwater and seeing nothing! 

That bizarre move of sprinting in the exact opposite direction became an unforgettable humiliation. If I’d had even a little bit of navigation skills, I wouldn’t have left such a foolish regret in a place I’ll probably only visit once in my life.

# Equipment You Need to Bring

The cruise company only provided **12L steel tanks (with H-valve, filled with air), weight belts, and weights blocks.** You need to bring everything else yourself.

(My own comprehensive list of equipment is attached in the end.)
## 1. Choosing and Using Your Regulators

Antarctic water temperatures usually stay **below 4°C**, and can drop as low as **–1°C**. The most common regulator failure is internal freezing, which causes continuous leaking. Once a **freeflow** occurs, gas sprays out like a broken faucet. <u>A standard 12L tank at 200 bar can run dry in just 2 to 5 minutes.</u>

While there are many regulators on the market designed for typical **cold-water** environments, with special materials and engineering to reduce low-temperature failures.

BUT!!!

==**No regulator can be guaranteed to operate reliably in extreme temperatures between –1°C and 4°C.** ==This means we cannot rely solely on a regulator's cold-water performance.

The good news is that we can manage the risk systematically through a combination of **1) cold-water-rated regulators, 2) redundant setups, and 3) proper procedures**, to keep the risk within control.

### What kind of regulators are the most freeze-resistant?

#### First Stages

**1) It must have a DIN connection.**

With a DIN connection, the O-ring sits inside the valve and is tightly compressed by the first stage, creating a sealed structure that’s less affected by temperature changes. In contrast, a Yoke connection has the O-ring exposed on the outside, which can expand or contract in cold water and create gaps, leading to leaks.

**2) It must be fully environmentally sealed.**

A fully environmentally sealed first stage (e.g. Scubapro Mk19) separates the internal mechanism from the surrounding water while still transmitting external pressure via a diaphragm. This keeps the inside dry and less prone to freezing.

In contrast, an open-design first stage has its internal parts directly exposed to the water. While simpler and easier to maintain, and even used in many high-performance regulators (e.g. Scubapro Mk25), its design inherently carries a higher risk of freezing in polar conditions. For safety, we opt for fully sealed first stages in extreme cold.

**3) It must be certified to the low-temperature standard EN250A.**

**EN250A** is the strictest industrial standard for cold-water performance for regulators. It means the regulator has passed extreme tests in 4°C water, proving it can handle the harshest conditions.

<u>You might wonder: our dive sites can reach –1°C, so isn’t a test at 4°C unreliable? </u>

Not really. **EN250A** isn’t just a low-temperature test. It’s an all-out stress test performed at 4°C, including heavy breathing, continuous high-pressure gas supply, and other scenarios that maximize freezing risk. Think of it as the engineering equivalent of a pass/fail line: the test deliberately creates the worst-case scenario, whereas in real dives, as long as you’re careful, don’t gasp at the surface or hyperventilate underwater, you’ll be fine.

So even in 0°C water, a regulator certified EN250A at 4°C can be sufficient and safe for use. 

Look for the **EN250A mark!** It’s usually stamped on the first stage’s metal body and included in the manual.

>[!Know the right mark:]
>- EN250 – Passed the basic test, but not a cold-water test.  
>- EN250A >10°C – Only suitable for water above 10°C.
>- **EN250A** – This is the one we need.

#### Second Stages

**1) Must have a full metal casing**

 Metal conducts heat quickly. When the internal temperature of the second stage drops, it can draw warmth from the surrounding seawater, keeping it relatively stable. Plastic casings conduct heat poorly; when the inside cools, heat doesn’t flow in, the cold air accumulates, and it can freeze solid.

**2) The same goes for your backup**

 In many divers’ setups, the primary second stage is carefully chosen for reliability, while the backup is often a cheap plastic one just for show. In Antarctica, your backup second stage truly needs to perform when it matters. It shouldn’t just work, but also must be **equally reliable as your primary regulator**.
 
So, if your first stage has a **DIN connection, is fully sealed, and carries the EN250A certification**, and **your second stage has a** **full metal casing**, we’ve already minimized the chance of hardware failure. 

Next, it’s all about further reducing risk through proper configuration and careful operation.

### Redundant Setup

As mentioned earlier in the skills section, polar dives usually provide tanks equipped with an **H-valve**. An H-valve has two completely independent outlets, each of which can be connected to a full regulator system. If one supply line freezes and starts leaking, you can shut off that side, and the other line remains unaffected. 

In tropical recreational diving, the backup second stage is mainly used to share air with a buddy running low. Since it shares the same first stage as the primary regulator, this doesn’t pose a significant problem.

However, **in polar diving, the backup second stage is primarily intended as a personal air source in case your own regulator fails.** If a leak occurs and your backup second stage is still connected to the same first stage, switching won’t help, cuz you’ve already lost that supply line. Therefore, <u>in polar diving, the backup second stage must come from a completely independent air path.</u>

So we need **two fully independent regulator systems**! Not just two second stages like in tropical recreational diving, but **two first stages as well**. 

The question then becomes: how should the hoses of these two regulator systems be routed to minimize entanglement and allow a smooth, effortless switch to the backup air supply in case of failure?

#### Short Hose Configuration

If you’re already familiar with doubles diving, you can skip this part.

Among the divers on our cruise, although everyone had slightly different personal preferences for hose routing, almost all of them used a **short-hose backup second stage**, a hose about **56 cm long** that runs from the right side of the neck to just under the chin, leaving no excess line floating around. A small bungee keeps it snug under the chin like a necklace. In an actual air-loss situation, you can grab it and put it in your mouth instantly, instead of fumbling like I used to—tucking the backup into a BC pocket, looking down, and digging it out. This setup is just much smoother and more practical.

Now that we have **two fully independent, quick-switch freeze-resistant regulators**, all that’s left is to avoid a few common operational pitfalls, and the regulators won’t give us any more trouble.

### No-Nos for Regulators!

Even with careful gear choices, regulators can still freeze. Why? **Because we can’t eliminate all sources of moisture**: water vapor in the air, tiny droplets introduced during assembly or disassembly, O-rings that let a little seep in as they age, so even a fully sealed first stage isn’t 100% dry. That leftover moisture can still freeze! So ice, why do you form so easily?! (me furiously roaring at the laws of physics.)

Just Remember:

 #### 1. Do NOT rinse your regulators in fresh water after each dive.

This can unintentionally introduce moisture. We only rinse them at the end of the trip.

 #### 2. Do NOT purge and breathe from your regulator on the surface unless necessary.

Our proper procedure is: take a quick test breath on the surface to make sure both regulator systems are working, then decisively enter the water. Once submerged, start normal, steady breathing. In extreme cold air, the warm moisture from your exhalation can quickly condense inside the regulator and freeze.

You might ask: <u>“If Antarctic water can be as low as –1°C, near freezing, why can we breathe and purge normally underwater?” </u>
(Curious minds add so much more work for me!)

>**Attention!** Regulator freezing doesn’t depend on the absolute temperature outside. It depends on the **local temperature inside the regulator**.

Inhaling and purging both involve rapid expansion of gas within the regulator. The highly compressed gas in the tank passes through the first and second stages, transforming into breathable air. During this expansion, the gas does work and consumes heat, **causing the local temperature inside the regulator to drop far below the freezing point.** If external heat can’t replenish it quickly enough, this cold pocket persists, and ice forms.

This risk is especially high at the surface, because air has low thermal conductivity and heat capacity, so heat replenishes very slowly. So if you inhale or purge and then exhale warm, moist air, the regulator can freeze.

Underwater, it’s a completely different story. **Water has much higher thermal conductivity and heat capacity than air.** Even if the seawater is near freezing, it can quickly supply heat to the regulator whenever rapid gas expansion causes a local temperature drop. 

>In other words, when the regulator is immersed in water, **the surrounding water helps counteract the extreme cooling from gas expansion**, making it much less likely to reach freezing.

#### 3.Do NOT reduce the second-stage breathing resistance too much

In polar diving, **a slightly more effortful breathing style is actually safer than effortless, silky-smooth breathing**.

The more sensitive your second stage is, the easier it is to inhale, and the more violently the valve opens with even a light breath. This causes the gas inside the regulator to expand rapidly, which cools it down sharply. The local temperature inside can easily drop below freezing.

I set the venturi (breathing resistance) knob on my second stage to a position where it takes a little more effort to inhale. This ensures smooth breathing while reducing the risk of over-sensitivity causing internal icing.

So by this point, you are already using the most cold-resistant regulators, had full redundancy in place, and theoretically, things should have been bulletproof. **But if you can’t resist deep breaths at the surface or can't stop hyperventilating under the water, even the toughest regulator will fail on you.**

All the efforts, carefully choosing the right regulators, setting up two complete independent systems, laying out the hoses in the most ergonomic and scientific way, and strictly following all the do’s-and-don’ts, was for one simple goal:

>Don’t freeze. 
>Don’t freeze. 
>**Don’t freeze.**

Let me put on my victory declaration：

>**Not a single freeflow occurred during my entire Antarctic trip!**

## 2. How to Stay Warm from Head to Toe

Even though I knew from paper that Antarctic waters can drop to **-1°C**, I had no real idea how cold that actually is. I’m used to diving in tropical waters around **27°C**. **For me, 25°C is already uncomfortable.** I would shiver in a 5 mm wetsuit. Drop another couple of degrees, and I might cramp up or even lose clarity of mind. Going from 27°C tropical water straight to 0°C in Antarctica, I had no clue what kind of “magic suit” would be enough to survive that level of cold.

Insufficient insulation isn’t just about feeling chilly or catching a cold，it can trigger a cascade of physiological failures that **directly threaten your life**. At first, you might just shiver.Later, severe hypothermia sets in, your mind goes fuzzy, your regulator slips from your mouth, and drowning becomes a real risk. In polar diving, this process happens much faster.

### Three Layer Strategy

#### Outer Layer - Drysuit

**A drysuit is basically a waterproof shell** that keeps your body dry by isolating you from the surrounding water. It also traps a layer of air inside which adds extra insulation. <u>In polar diving, there’s no option to go wet.</u> Even the thickest wetsuit can’t handle near-freezing water.

Most polar divers opt for **trilaminate drysuits**, though a few still use **neoprene suits**.

**Trilaminate drysuits** are flexible shells without much inherent insulation. Their main advantage is that you can layer thick undergarments inside, effectively wrapping yourself in a custom blanket. This system is very flexible: in slightly warmer water, just swap for a thinner undergarment instead of changing the entire suit. Plus, trilaminate drysuits dry quickly. After a dive on day one, they’re usually fully dry by day two, no soggy misery.

**Neoprene** suits are like sponge-rubber material, which provides some inherent insulation and better hydrodynamics. But neoprene compresses under depth, reducing insulation, and you can’t add thick undergarments inside to customize warmth. If you insist on neoprene for polar diving, go for a suit **6.5mm or thicker.**

On my trip, about **90% of divers wore trilaminate drysuits**, and 10% wore neoprene. 

I’ll assume you’re wearing a trilaminate suit too, and next we’ll look at what to layer underneath.

#### Mid Layer - Undergarment

The drysuit is essentially just a waterproof shell. **The real warmth comes from the undergarment inside**. It’s like a blanket you wear around your body.

==So why not just stuff your winter fleece and thermal leggings into a drysuit?==

**First, everyday clothes don’t handle pressure well.** As you descend, the air trapped in the material gets compressed. Once the fibers lose loft, the insulation drops significantly. Many professional dive undergarments use pre-compressed materials, such as Thinsulate. These materials are factory-compressed to simulate underwater conditions (around 4–5 atmospheres), so when you dive, they don’t compress much further and maintain stable insulation.

**A more practical point is that drysuits aren’t completely leak-proof.** Ordinary warm clothing, once soaked, quickly turns into a cold layer clinging to your skin. Professional dive undergarments usually have less than 1% water absorption (compared to over 30% for regular clothes). Their strength is that they stay warm not only when dry but also retain significant insulation if they get wet. In the event of a drysuit leak, the undergarment helps you safely finish the dive instead of rapidly losing body heat.

The key metric for an undergarment’s warmth is its **fiber density (weight in g/m²)**. Generally, the higher the density, the lower the temperature it’s suitable for.

>[!For example:]
>- 200 g/m² – temperate waters around 20°C
>- 300 g/m² – cold waters around 15°C
>- **400 g/m² – waters below 10°C**  

For the Antarctic, we simply go for undergarments with **400 g/m²** or more. Most undergarments clearly indicate material and density on the label, for example, typical cold-water materials like “Thinsulate 400 g/m²” or “PrimaLoft Gold 400 g.” Some products even incorporate the density into their name, such as Santi’s BZ400 or Navyfel’s B420.

#### Base Layer - Moisture-Wicking Layer

The base layer isn’t just there to separate your skin from the thick undergarment and make you more comfortable. It also has a crucial **moisture-wicking function**.

**Do you sweat in Antarctica? Absolutely,** and often before you even enter the water. In the cramped, stuffy cabin, a few bends, zippers, and putting on your thick undergarment can already burn a lot of energy. By the time you step out onto the zodiac, you’re hit by the Antarctic wind. If your sweat doesn’t get wicked away quickly, it will linger on your skin like a cold, wet towel.

That’s why the base layer **must be quick-drying and moisture-wicking**. It should fit snugly without being restrictive, so that sweat can be pulled away from the skin by the fibers. The easiest choice is a thin synthetic material, such as polyester or Polartec. **Many professional ski brands’ base layers work perfectly for diving.** The ideal fit is thin and close to the body, with a weight under 150g. Don’t worry about it being too thin. The base layer isn’t meant for warmth. Wearing two layers can actually hinder moisture management, and in addition, the drysuit has limited space. Too thick a base layer will compress your undergarment, your main insulating layer and reduce overall warmth.

>**Never choose cotton!** Cotton can absorb up to 25 times its own weight in water. Wearing cotton in Antarctica is basically a self-destruct mode. It’s far worse than wearing nothing.

### Keeping Your Head, Hands, and Feet Warm

In fact, the parts of the body that usually get cold first are the extremities: **the head, hands, and feet**. Sometimes your core feels warm and comfortable, but your fingers are already stinging or numb. So, besides properly keeping your core warm with the three-layer system, you also need to pay special attention to protecting your head, hands, and feet.
#### Head

For the hood, we actually used a standard Neoprene hood—the same material as in tropical diving—but the recommended thickness is **8–10mm.** I couldn’t find one this thick, so I just layered two hoods (6mm + 7mm = 13mm). My head stayed completely warm with no discomfort.

The hood must fit snugly. Too loose, and water circulation will carry away heat; too tight, and it will restrict blood flow. The right feel is slightly tight, but it shouldn’t press on the temples or interfere with opening your mouth to bite the regulator.

It’s best to choose a **long-collar hood**. A standard hood usually only reaches mid-neck; the long collar version reaches the collarbone. Pull the long collar down to cover your neck seal, then flip the drysuit neck collar over it so no skin is exposed. Even a 1mm gap lets cold water circulate and steal heat quickly.

There’s no dry hood option because you need to see, breathe through the regulator, and equalize your ears, so it can’t be fully sealed. But a thick wet hood is more than sufficient. On our cruise, experienced Antarctic divers basically used the **K01 long collar 8mm hood.**

#### Face

The face is the only part of the body exposed to water. If you tuck the mask properly into the edge of your hood, the area around your eyes won’t touch the seawater, leaving only your lips and the surrounding skin exposed. Lips get cold very easily. Usually in the first five minutes back on the boat, my ability to speak collapses, and I can barely articulate words.

**But I didn’t do any special protection for my face**. Although my lips get a bit numb, honestly, my face isn’t as cold as my fully protected fingers.

A few divers on our trip used full-face masks, which also protect the lips. The regulator is built into the mask, allowing natural breathing through the mouth and nose. However, if water gets in or the mask fogs, it’s tricky to deal with. Emergency gas-switching procedures are also more complicated with full-face masks, so they require dedicated training and practice and specialty course.

**In a place like Antarctica, every extra emergency procedure is a burden**. Personally, I don’t think full-face masks are necessary. The traditional hood plus mask setup is reliable and sufficient.

#### Hands

For the hands, we wear dry gloves with liner gloves underneath. The outer layer is waterproof and sealed, while the inner liner provides warmth. **Don’t even consider using wet gloves. They won’t protect against 0°C seawater, no matter how thick.** 

Dry gloves are a bit like the thick rubber waterproof gloves used by plumbers. The connection method between drysuits and gloves varies by brand, but once you get used to it, the differences don’t matter much. **The most important thing is whether the seal is secure.** My drysuit uses a removable wrist seal system. Before putting on the drysuit, you take the wrist seal off the sleeve, then align the rubber cuff of the dry glove with the seal ring on the suit and press it down bit by bit until fully fitted, creating a tight seal. For someone like me with clumsy hands, this takes patience, but the seal works perfectly. I never had a single leak.

The glove liners need to be warm, but not too thick, to retain dexterity. If the liner is too bulky, your reactions slow down. For example, finding and operating the quick-release valve on the BC can take forever, which is a safety risk, and I also need to operate my camera. A **1–2 mm fleece liner** works best. Never shove thick ski gloves inside dry gloves. Major dive brands like Fourth Element, Santi, and BARE offer glove liners specifically designed for extreme cold (<4 °C) conditions.

#### Feet

Drysuits usually come with integrated waterproof boots or socks, so you don’t need to worry about foot waterproofing. But if your suit has integrated socks instead of boots, you need to wear a pair of **drysuit boots** over them—ideally with a firm sole and an ankle strap. Brands like DUI and ScubaPro offer drysuit boots specifically for this. Otherwise, if your feet inflate during a dive, the boots could slip off along with the fins. I personally use a suit with integrated socks and pair it with Navyfel boots. I go **one size up from my usual shoe size**, so I can wear thick liner socks and still slip my foot in easily. They are easy to put on and secure.

For warmth, the socks can be thicker since you don’t need fine dexterity in your feet. I start with a pair of **everyday non-cotton socks** (many sports brands, like Adidas, make thick moisture-wicking socks). Over that, I wear a **professional polar diving sock liner**, such as polar socks from Fourth Element or DUI.

### What if I’m still cold even after wearing all that?

I'm bundled up like the Michelin Man and I'm still freezing.
What am I supposed to do now?

#### Heated Systems

At this point, you have to rely on electrically heated gear, such as:

- **Full-body heated undergarments** (e.g., Santi BZ420 Heated), which can warm the entire body except hands and feet.

- **Heated vests**, which focus on the core area.

- **Separate heated gloves or socks**, providing extra warmth to the most vulnerable extremities.

All of these work on the same principle: embedded resistive wires powered by fully waterproof external batteries.

**The heating duration depends on the heated area and battery capacity.** For example, a Santi 24Ah battery can power a heated vest for about 4 hours, but if you run full-body heating, it drops to around 1.5 hours.

#### How to Put On Heated Systems

- Heated undergarment set: These are undergarments with built-in heating. Wear them as your mid-layer and simply route the cables through the drysuit’s chest valve to connect to the external battery.

- Heated vest: Wear this on top of your base layer but under your mid-layer, **ensuring your normal layering is intact**.

- Heated gloves: Can be worn directly on your hands without extra liners. Note that heated gloves are usually much thicker than standard liners, so you may need a larger size dry glove to accommodate them.

>**Important:** Heated gear is only **supplemental warmth** and should not replace proper insulation (unless it’s a full-body heated undergarment like the Santi BZ420x Heated). For example, wearing a 300g undergarment (suitable for ~15°C water) plus a heated vest is **not sufficient** for polar diving. Electric heating alone cannot offset the rapid heat loss to near-freezing water. And if the battery dies, you lose your last layer of protection. Always ensure your **non-heated insulation is reliable** before relying on electric heat.

#### How to Use Heated Systems

The controls for electric-heated gear are usually on the external battery itself, with High/Medium/Low power settings and LED lights showing the remaining battery level.

>[!TIPS]
>- **Don’t turn it on when you don't feel the cold yet.** Battery life is limited. If it dies when you really need it, you’ll regret it. Usually, it’s best to turn it on halfway through the dive, near the end, or when back on the zodiac facing the icy wind. That moment, you’ll feel like the warmest person alive.
>
>- **You could use it as a backup in case of drysuit flooding.** Even if your drysuit takes on some water, the electric heating will keep generating warmth to counteract heat loss to the sea. It’s fully waterproof, so there’s no risk of electric shock, but if the leak is severe, **ascend immediately**. Don’t rely on electric heating to tough it out.

#### Do I Need Heated Systems?

<u>Even in the polar regions, heated garments are not always necessary.</u> It depends on personal cold tolerance and the diving scenario. In my case, for example, the average water temperature was **1–2°C**, we only did **one dive per day**, and the longest dive lasted just **40 minutes.**

**I personally managed just fine without electric heating.** I felt like I could stay comfortable even up to an hour. Even on the surface, in the zodiac back to the ship, I wasn’t cold at all. The only part that felt a bit chilly was my fingers, but it was just mildly uncomfortable, not painful or numb, so it wasn’t a serious issue.

**However, if you are extremely sensitive to cold, plan to dive multiple times per day, or dive for over an hour, then electric heating is worth considering.** After all, it’s not cheap. A full-body electric heating suit like Santi’s, plus batteries, can cost more than many people’s drysuits.

From what I observed, about half of the divers on our cruise brought electric heating, and the other half didn’t. Yet no one was unable to dive because they didn’t have it. If you do feel too cold during a dive, let your buddy know and end the dive early. It’s not a big deal. Chances are, you’re just surfacing five minutes earlier than everyone else.

**So, a complete “polar diving magic suit” should consist of the following elements:**

- **Outer layer** – drysuit (Trilaminate material)
    
- **Middle layer** – undergarment of 400 g/m² or more
    
- **Base layer** – thin, snug, moisture-wicking layer (ski-specific gear works well)
    
- **Head** – 8–10 mm hood
    
- **Hands** – dry gloves + dive-brand glove liners
    
- **Feet** – regular sports socks + thickest dive-brand sock liners + (if using a drysuit with integrated socks) drysuit boots
    
- **Full-face mask** – I didn’t bring one and don’t recommend it
    
- **Electric heating vest/undersuit** – I didn’t use it; optional

With this magic suit, I spent 7 days diving in Antarctica, staying lively and energetic the entire time, without even the slightest hint of a cold!

==Call me - the **God of Cold Resistance**.==

## 3. How Much Weight Do I Need

We’re wearing the thickest undergarments and only carrying a single cylinder, so we need a **lot of weight** to sink properly.

>Take me as an example: 
Height: 160cm  
Weight: 45kg. 
Backplate: 3kg
Extra weight needed: **12kg**

So where should all this 12kg weight go?

**Using integrated weight pockets on your BC is strongly discouraged.**

First, it makes carrying your gear insanely difficult. You have to lift your rig—with the steel cylinder attached—onto the zodiac, and then back down after the dive. I simply can’t imagine adding another 12 kg to equipment that’s already enough to crush my biceps.

Second, the weight pockets on a BC simply cannot hold that many blocks.

<u>Most importantly, it makes it extremely difficult for a guide to pull you back onto the zodiac from the water.</u>

When you get back to the surface, the zodiac **has no ladder, no platform**. You’re literally pulled up by the guide’s raw strength.

>[!The standard procedure goes like:]
>1. The diver swims to the edge of the zodiac. 
>2. Hand up their camera.
>3. **Remove the weights and pass them up separately.**
>4. Slowly take off the backplate while still in the water.
>5. You support the cylinder underwater while the guide lifts from above.
>6. Grab the rope along the zodiac’s edge with both hands and, like doing a pull-up, give it all you’ve got to lift yourself up, while the guide simultaneously hauls you into the boat.

If your weights are integrated into your BC, the difficulty of this whole process increases dramatically. You **cannot remove the weights separately in step 3**, which means in steps 4 and 5 both you and the guide have to struggle a lot more.

So in the end, I reluctantly used a **weight belt**, but I really didn’t like this old school solution! **Weight belts are very unstable.** No matter how tightly I fastened the buckle on the boat, the 12 kg of lead still shifted side to side and up and down while swimming. Moreover, the belt buckle often got pressed under the backplate straps, so every time I got back to the boat, I had to fumble around in the water for a while just to remove the weight belt properly.

A much better solution is a **weight harness**, a weight system with straps on a backpack. About half the divers on our trip brought one. I feel that only experienced cold-water divers really understand its necessity. I **deeply regret not bringing one**. The harness is much more stable: it secures the weights to your torso, so they don’t shift side to side or up and down like a weight belt. It’s also much easier to remove. When you reach the edge of the zodiac, you can simply unclip a few buckles and hand the entire weight block up directly. If I ever have the chance to dive in the polar regions again, I will definitely bring one.

>**My final 12kg weight distribution:**
>
>- **4kg (2kg × 2)**: placed in the left and right pockets of the drysuit
>- **8kg (2kg × 4)**: threaded onto the waist weight belt

## 4. How to Deal With Low Visibility

Before the trip, I read a ton of posts and research documents about Antarctic diving. Everyone seemed to rave about the underwater visibility, so I thought I was heading to a different Antarctica! Out of our 10 dives, only about 2 had relatively clear water, and even those were nowhere near the visibility of tropical sites like Sipadan or Komodo. Most of the time, visibility was around **5 m**, and in the worst case, **less than 1 m**. At this level, it’s very easy to lose your buddy. You turn around for a shot, and suddenly they’re gone, leaving you no choice but to surface.

All our dives are day dives, so I didn’t realize how important a dive light could be. I only brought a handheld light for blackwater photography—great for illuminating subjects, but **not a high-output technical dive primary light**. This was, besides the weight harness, another piece of equipment I seriously regretted not bringing.

A **primary light** is a mandatory item in the **GUE Fundamentals** course. I used to think it was cumbersome to carry during the day, but Antarctica quickly slapped me on my face. On several occasions, my buddy was only about 3 meter away, and I simply couldn’t see. With a primary light, a few sweepings would immediately reveal each other’s location and orientation. Here, the primary light isn’t just for illumination. It’s a signaling tool.

Not many people carried a primary light on our cruise, which is understandable. Gear was already bulky with cameras and external heated battery packs.<u>But I still believe a primary light should be standard equipment for Antarctic dives.</u>

## 5. Don’t forget spare parts

Antarctica is an isolated location, so anything that’s prone to breaking or getting lost **needs a backup**, plus a complete set of **repair tools**

#### Essential Backups

- **Drysuit neck seal.** My own neck seal didn’t get damaged, but several divers tore theirs accidentally.

- **BC exhaust valve.** The small round cap at the bottom is easy to overlook. I forgot mine! During my check dive in Ushuaia, I tugged it hard and it popped off. With dry gloves, I didn’t feel a thing, and it sank to the seabed! Luckily, my superhuman teammates helped me retrieve it. If I hadn’t found it, my Antarctic diving trip would have been ruined. Later I realized you can temporarily fit an elephant trunk exhaust valve onto the BC, but it’s not an optimal solution. So to avoid the same tragedy, it’s better to prepare a spare BC exhaust valve.

- **400g undergarment.** If the drysuit floods severely, one undergarment won’t dry in a day, and you can’t dive the next day. Bring an extra to avoid missing any dives.

- **One high-pressure hose and one low-pressure hose.** Hoses that have been used too long can crack in the Antarctic.

- **Dive computer.** Life-critical equipment. Having a spare lets you sleep more peacefully.

#### Repair Kit

- **Wrench:** For assembling and disassembling regulator hoses.

- **Lubricant:** For assembling neck seals and dry gloves.

- **O-Ring set:** My first-stage O-Ring once fell off, and I calmly replaced it with a spare.

- **Aqua Seal:** Magical glue for emergency patches on the drysuit! Apply it wherever there’s a hole, let it fully air-dry within a day, and it will be as good as new.

## 6. Only bring equipment you are absolutely familiar with

**Antarctica is not the place to test new equipment.**

How long should the BCD shoulder straps be? Will the hood be too tight? Are the regulator hoses the right length? Are the pressure gauge readings reliable? These questions must be answered **before departure**. You should wear all the gear you plan to take to Antarctica and complete at least twenty to thirty practice dives. There’s no room for a “we’ll see when we get there” mentality. When you’re in 0°C water, wearing dry gloves with fingers nearly numb, your gear must be something you can operate accurately with your eyes closed.

# Closing Thoughts

I have no interest in pushing my limits. Normally, running a few steps tires me out, and jumping a couple of times requires buying myself a bubble tea as a reward. If it weren’t for seeing certain marine creatures with my own eyes, I’m the kind of gutter-dweller who would happily rot away in bed. But the problem with Antarctica is that it leaves no room for laziness. Any carelessness on my part could put me in danger.

Even as my sense of touch became dull, I had to execute precise control over my equipment. Inside my Michelin-tire-like suit, I had to wrestle with rapidly shifting buoyancy. In waters that forgive no errors, I had to stay composed. 

**Only when my muscles instinctively commanded this mechanical ensemble, did my mind finally break free, and my focus could wander.**
  
Then, I saw a kind of blue in the water I had never seen before. Sunlight passed through the ice, refracting into distinct layers of pale blue. It wasn’t the deep richness of tropical seas, but a clarity like liquid moonlight. I realized that the scenes I had previously only seen through ROVs, also existed here in the shallow Antarctic waters. Giant spider crabs and isopods, dense echinoderms, carpeted the seafloor. The near-freezing temperatures hadn’t slowed the pace of this world. On the contrary, some isopods and gastropods were even more active than their tropical relatives. I drifted over slowly, and a dozen isopods leapt out of the seaweed, like grasshoppers startled in a meadow.

**Scuba diving is a very quiet sport.** Diving in Antarctica, I never once felt that adrenaline-fueled rush of pushing past my limits. What I felt instead, was a simple, steady joy to be a calm observer in this icy underwater world.

I came, and I saw.

It wasn’t until I started writing this guide that I realized the Mk25 has this inherent drawback. Although my regulator did not experience any leaks or failures during this trip, I still recommend that divers choose a fully sealed first stage, such as the Mk19.
